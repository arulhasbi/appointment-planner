# Appointment Planner

Hi, it's me again with another react project from codecademy full-stack engineer course path. This time I built an appointment planner app which only consists of two pages: Contacts and Appointments.

### Project Description

To do the project, actually codecademy provides a dedicated walkthrough, but I decided not to follow it. Instead, I challenge myself to come up with ideas on how the appointment planner would looks like, but in its simple, beginner-friendly form and yet still demonstrate the _appointment planner_. In the end, the point of this project is to acquaint myself more about react library and its features like life-cycle, hooks, router, etc. 

1.  Contact Page

    - Fetch all contact (if any) and displays it through horizontal scrolling
    - Save a new contact by receiving inputs (name, phone, & email) from users

2.  Appointment Page

    - Fetch all appointment (if any) and displays it through horizontal scrolling
    - Save a new appointment by receiving inputs (title, contact, date, & time) from users
